# Just Remind Me

(WIP). Draft for a dead simple reminder app created with React Native.

### Background

Inspired by (a no longer existing) version of one of my favourite apps called "Aha!". That lets you set a reminder with only text and notification time - getting rid of all possible combined functionalites like a checklist, priority-sorting, status, locations, sharing, notes etc.

It just lets you add reminders. Nothing. Else.


### Resources
* [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)

* Structure for Redux is set up using [Ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) modular approach.
